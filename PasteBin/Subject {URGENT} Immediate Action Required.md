**Title:** Subject: [URGENT] Immediate Action Required
Dear [REDACTED],
 
Recent trials with the material, [REDACTED], have shown an unexpected reaction. If this substance penetrates an individual's skin through a cut or orifice, the subject falls into a coma. While this reaction may seem concerning, we have found that these only happen in certain circumstances. For example, when tested in a remote location, the subject was completely unharmed. See attached file for further information about the tests.
 
We on the research team believe this is completely manageable and a non problem. We're simply alerting you to a minor snag to request more resources for further research. I know you may think this is a large ask after my previous email but this is the most important project this company has encountered. The cost of funding our research is nominal compared to the benefits we could reap.
 
Sincerely,
[[Liam Anderson|Liam [REDACTED] ]]
