The research on [[Substance|REDACTED]] presents challenges, yet [[Subject 5 - David Lee]]'s immunity is absolutely captivating. We have yet to replicate its healing properties outside of the remote location.
 
A few of my fellow researchers seem to have become captivated by the idea that there's some higher being out there deciding who falls into a coma or not. Superstition has no place among our ranks, but we didn't even get a chance to fire them. They tested the pills on themselves out of nowhere. At least we have more bodies to test on, I'm working on a report right now. Our focus remains on unlocking [[Substance|REDACTED]]'s potential for humanity's benefit, regardless the sacrifices.
