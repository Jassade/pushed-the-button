In the top center of the image is a line drawing of an eye.
Below the eye the word `DISGUSTING` is written in quotes.
At the bottom center is a broken knife over blood splatter.

There is also Morse code `-- .` => `ME`
# BOW.png
![[BOW.png]]
The picture is of an in progress game of Pong. The score is P1:0 P2:25

Hidden Morse code `-... . .- -` => `BEAT`
# CHEATER.png
![[CHEATER.png]]
Image is of what appears to be a victory shot. With a black and white checker pattern at the top. the bottom 2/3 is rainbow colored columns, the number 1000 is superimposed on top.

Hidden Morse code `-.- --- ..-` => `KOU`
I believe that the first letter may be cut off giving it `--.- --- ..-` => `YOU`
# DEATH.png
![[DEATH.png]]
The same eye from AREYOUPROUD.png is featured here.
There is a lot of blood vs the other image and the knife is not broken.
The text `IS THERE BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS?` is clearly displayed.
