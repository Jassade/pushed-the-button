# Findings

The URL fragment in the Description is to a Google Drive file. This file is an incident report of the three scientists who took the experimental pills unprompted. It recontextualizes Liam’s response from the previous note.
The messages in the video could easily be from the three scientists, to us, about Liam not understanding that they were not forced to take the pills but did so willingly.

# Lore
The incident report brings up more questions than answers, but does begin to shed light on some of the earliest info we have gotten. From [[1 - TheFirstVictim.mp4#Video Content]] “THE COMPUTER ISNT YOUR FRIEND” When subjects took the substance “near” electricity or computer equipment they fell into a coma. The scientist did something similar but seemed to [[Incident Report on Self-Experimentation of Researchers]] have a ritualistic portion to it. Then followed up with this video, its images (which could easily be of two women and a man matching the descriptions of the three scientists) and the messages of giving themselves willingly. It seems that this substance steals the consciousness of someone when administered the substance near technology (specifically electronic tech).
