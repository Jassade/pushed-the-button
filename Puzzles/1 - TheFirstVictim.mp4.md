# Description
Subject: URGENT - PLEASE OPEN IMMEDIATELY 
Dhear [REDACTED], I am writing to request 9that you reconsider your decision to terminate my recent experiments. Recent trials of the [REDACTED] havKe sjhown incredible potential, it could very well solve everything. Halting our work now could rGesult in milPlions dying that didn’t need to.

This material very well could be the solution to ending all wars, diseasevs and more. The benefits far outweigh the risks discussed in our previous conversation. The material is already svhowing amazing results with animal subjects.

Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
[[Liam Anderson|Liam [REDACTED] ]]
