March 28th.
So many people, so many people have pushed the button.
Three more people join thousands but I was the first

There Is No Escape from Curiosity this is a warning to you true pain is endless and I feel true pain
# Video Content
Single pixelated button, gray bottom red button.
Half depressed, slowly lowers until fully depressed.
Once depressed a splatter of blood appears on screen.
Button then rebounds to fully open state and begins to depress again.
Another splatter, the button resets and continues the cycle for the rest of the video speeding up each time.
There are a total of 35 button presses.
By the end the screen is mostly filled with overlapping splatters, hand prints, and claw marks.

	- Is from the POV of the first person to push the button (perhaps this is the aforementioned [[People/HE|HE]])
	- They claim to have witnessed multiple civilizations created making them very old
- Again the themes of [[Verses#PROVERBS#16-18]] are brought up particularly “Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall”
- More people are choosing to press the button, whether for greed, pride, or some other motivation it does not seem to be a good thing.
- No one heads the warnings
