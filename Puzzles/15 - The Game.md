The PasteBin [[BLIND]] gave us a DropBox link which included an "login" program called `HeadResearcherLogin.exe` (This file is located in this repo, but you are best served getting from the DropBox), a folder of images and sounds [[Assets]] and a list of [[TheGame/COMMANDMENTS]]

The EXE name has been changed. It was `IntegraLabs.exe` it is now `HeadResearcherLogin.exe`. The two files are otherwise exactly the same.
   
Liam Anderson is the Lead Research Scientist at Intergra Labs. It could be Devin Mitchell although I don't think we know his title for sure.

None the less I have tried logical combinations for usernames
`liam`, `liamanderson`, `landerson`, `anderson`, `devin`, `devinmitchell`, `dmitchell`, `mitchell` with both suspected passwords `UUDDLRLRBA`, `TSAZGLEJAY` to no avail.
