# PROVERBS
## 16-18
Arrogance puts a person at risk for disaster.
> 16 How much better to get wisdom than gold! To get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.
> 17 The highway of the upright turns aside from evil; whoever guards his way preserves his life.
> 18 Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.
# Hebrews
## 10:26-27
Knowing that what you are doing is a sin but continuing to do it, the sin on your soul can not be removed or forgiven.
> 26 If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left,
> 27 but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.
