# PROVERBS
## 16-18
Arrogance puts a person at risk for disaster.
> 16 How much better to get wisdom than gold! To get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.
> 17 The highway of the upright turns aside from evil; whoever guards his way preserves his life.
> 18 Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.
# Hebrews
## 10:26-27
Knowing that what you are doing is a sin but continuing to do it, the sin on your soul can not be removed or forgiven.
> 26 If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left,
> 27 but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.

# Amos
## 9:1-4
 saw the Lord standing by the altar, and he said:

>1 Strike the tops of the pillars so that the thresholds shake.  
> Bring them down on the heads of all the people; those who are left I will kill with the sword.  
> Not one will get away, none will escape.  
>2 Though they dig down to the depths below, from there my hand will take them.  
> Though they climb up to the heavens above, from there I will bring them down.  
>3 Though they hide themselves on the top of Carmel, there I will hunt them down and seize them. Though they hide from my eyes at the bottom of the sea, there I will command the serpent to bite them.
>4 Though they are driven into exile by their enemies, there I will command the sword to slay them.

> “I will keep my eye on them for harm and not for good.”
